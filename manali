To remove a Git branch, you can use the following commands depending on whether you want to delete a local branch or a remote branch.

1. Delete a Local Branch
To delete a local branch, use:

bash
Copy code
git branch -d branch_name
If the branch has unmerged changes and you still want to delete it, use:

bash
Copy code
git branch -D branch_name
2. Delete a Remote Branch
To delete a branch from a remote repository, use:

bash
Copy code
git push origin --delete branch_name
Summary
Local Branch: Use git branch -d branch_name or git branch -D branch_name for forced deletion.
Remote Branch: Use git push origin --delete branch_name.
Make sure you have checked out of the branch you want to delete locally! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
